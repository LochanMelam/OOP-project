Our Idea is to create a simple python based employee management system that utilizes Object Oriented Programming. Run the script using the following code in ther command line after navigating into the directory:
```
python3 OOP-project.py 
```
Then you will be presented with 4 options :
```
Enter 1. To display Details of an existing User
Enter 2. To delete Profile of an existing User
Enter 3. To Modify detail's of an existing User
Enter 4. To add a new User
```
The script will execute actions according to the given input given by the user.
